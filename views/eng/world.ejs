        <h4 align = "center"> Prologue </h4>
        <p align = "justify"> The Earth used to live peaceful days. The day began and humanity began to work in search of prosperity. Livestock farmers prepared the feed for their cattle, artisans organized their materials for making woolen clothes, farmers sowed the land and waited for a prosperous and storm-free day so as not to spoil the harvest. </p>
        <p align = "justify"> In professional corporations, apprentices, that is, young people who learned the craft of their master without receiving a penny, learned all the teaching for those who may one day master their work with mastery. While the newsmen, apprentices who completed their apprenticeship, began to receive salaries in order to save and open their own workshop and become a master. Masters, wise masters of a certain labor art, they commanded the work processes, always aiming to teach apprentices and seek their greatest profit. Therefore, a very common agreement between the families of the time. </p>
        <p align = "justify"> It so happens that, in the middle of 200 years before <text class = "text-vernesis "> VERNESIS </text> humanity began to face new limits for its experience. <b>KAUS AUSTRALIS</b>, also known as Epsilon Sagittarii, the main star in the constellation of Sagittarius, which represents the tenth sign of the zodiac, it deviated from its route and, the initially beautiful shooting star that crossed illuminating the horizon of a starry night sky, fell with devastating violence on Planet Earth, causing a deafening crash. The famous Poet of the extinct Göktürk civilization, Pir Mehmed, compared the crash to 1,000 volcanoes erupting simultaneously. </p>
        <p align = "justify"> This phenomenon became known as <i> “THE FALL” </i> of the star <b> KAUS AUSTRALIS </b>, or just A.Q, its acronym. Along with the deafening crash, a strange effect occurred, changing common sense and understanding of everything that existed. </p>
        <p align = "justify"> The celestial energy of the star has been gradually deposited on land over the decades, changing the laws of physics and nature little by little. Rational beings used tourism as a means of capitalizing resources, given the curiosity of everyone with the star. In the middle of 50 years before <text class = "text-vernesis">VERNESIS</text>, that is, 150 years after A.Q, nature began to manifest itself in a more vivid and intelligent way, as if they were conscious. The creatures became stronger and more rational, the elements began to exude the same stellar energy with the whole around them. Everything was interconnected by the stellar essence. Everything was coming together by stellar essence. </p>
        <p align = "justify"> Scholars sought to understand the phenomena caused by the star, sought to explain what the stellar essence was, but no logical justification, methodological or scientific explanation or even proof of this phenomenon. Over the years, the Earth has become more and more interconnected with the energy of the star, to the point that a great event occurred that completely changed the history of humanity and even the concept of humanity: <text class = "text-vernesis ">VERNESIS</text>. When the Earth absorbed all the stellar energy and interconnected with it, the terrestrial civilization was completely consumed overnight, leaving in its place a horrible death trail. The tourist spot where the star was, gave way to a gigantic crater in a lifeless terrain, having only the stagnant and immobile star in place. Around it, a mist, a kind of nebula that made stellar energy evident. </p>
        <p align = "justify"> The first human who saw in the darkness that beautiful flashy fog on the horizon, ran to see that beautiful event. Touching the star, if in a place completely different from the reality you knew. There was only one huge and deep galaxy that soon turned into a dungeon full of challenges. </p>
        <p align = "justify"> It was not long before greedy and curious explorers tried to find out more about the star. Strangely as humans were touching the star, a different discovery emerged, however, the more people touched it, the survival rate decreased dramatically. It did not take long for a rumor to occur of the deaths caused to those who touched the star, but of the extreme wealth and power that came from those who touched it and survived. </p>
        <p align = "justify"> About 400 years after the Fall (D.Q), a human proved himself worthy of the prize that that alternative space held. After facing the 9 trials of the place, known as the Nine Circles of Hell, he was considered capable of being blessed by the celestial energy and then wore the power of the constellation for decades, promoting his will absolutely throughout the world. Throughout his life, after exactly 90 years, the constellation abandoned him for inexplicable reasons, and since then, he and other constellations have sent their stars to Earth in a 9-decade cycle. And so, the search cycle for the domination of the power of <text class = "text-vernesis ">VERNESIS</h3>. </p>

        <h4 align = "center"> <text class = "text-vernesis"> Vernesis: </text> Stellar Energy </h4>
        <p align = "justify"> Stellar energy is a force that resides in each fragment of matter, emanated steadily. This energy can, to some extent, be manipulated; however, its main characteristic is conceptualized in the concept of quantity in proportion to the body's mass. Thus, stars have, in general, more energy than planets and these, in turn, they also generally have more stellar energy than other smaller bodies. </p>
        <p align = "justify"> Another characteristic of stellar energy is its great tendency to disperse through matter. Unless there is an insulating factor, either through the manipulation of stellar energy itself, or else the vacuum of space itself, it is customary for this force to be shared by all bodies in contact. It was this phenomenon that happened to planet Earth after the fall of <b>Kaus Australis</b>, the main star in the constellation of Sagittarius. </p>

        <h4 align = "center"> <text class = "text-vernesis"> Vernesis: </text>Dungeons</h4>
        <p align = "justify"> By constantly increasing its mass, a body accumulates, as a consequence, also a considerable amount of stellar energy. In this constant growth, at a certain point, the excess finally begins to take shape and organize itself, making this energy create a utility for itself. This excess, for some reason, always follows a pattern: the creation of the <b>Stars</b> and the challenges imposed to achieve them. The consequence of this manifestation of energy in a utility, of course, it also follows the same rules: the more excess energy, the more powerful the star will be. </p>
        <p align = "justify"> The planets, each being also a celestial body, are not seen as an exception to this rule; however, of all, only one was able to manifest this excess due to the interaction with Kaus Australis: the planet Earth. Naturally, the planet also being fed by excess star energy, began to manifest the same utility as the rest of the stars in the universe. Even so, it was to be expected that this exception to the rule would also come with its unique characteristics. The supposed terrestrial system, having this force in abundance, did not transform if in a dungeon by itself, but it generated several passages to varied dungeons within itself, all following concepts already pre-existing on the planet in question. The reason why the manifestation of stellar energy happened this way, for humans, still remains a mystery; however, with so many stars falling, the Earth is headed towards being the celestial body with the greatest amount of stellar energy within itself. </p>

        <h4 align = "center"> <text class = "text-vernesis"> Vernesis: </text> Race for power </h4>
        <p align = "justify"> Due to the primordial influence of a variation of the energy that originated the world, the stellar energy that is derived from the big bang, the world, as a whole, started to react to this in an unexpected way. From inanimate entities to animated entities, all were interconnected through the same flow of energy. </p>
        <p align = "justify"> With the constant efforts of humans, over four centuries, to conquer <b>KAUS AUSTRALIS</b>, it has been discovered that this connection can be used to increase the power of mortal life , making a single man capable of decimating cities overnight. The manipulation of this energy is called <b>STAR</b> and has become easily popular among civilizations as measures of military power. </p>
        <p align = "justify"> Although it was a necessity to have that kind of power, human greed did not restrain itself with the knowledge and usefulness that it could provide if used in a more democratic way. In a matter of a few years, the leaders of the most important civilizations <text class = "red">Kaus, Noh, Uria, Nidheim and Silverwater</text> sought to create an army of warriors who were able to subdue enemy cities to exploit their resources and expand their territories. </p>
        <p align = "justify"> Of course, you could do that with the most common <i>Stars</i>, yet they were completely predictable due to their constant use and conquest. Thus, the most coveted <i>Stars</i> were those from the constellations. </p>
