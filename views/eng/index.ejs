        <div class="container block-creatures mb-1">
          <p align="center"><b>Supernatural Creatures:</b> from simple zombies to dragons, the Vernesis bestiary is filled with incredible creatures and completely divergent levels of danger. Some can be found easily wandering around the world of Vernesis, while others... only when a star comes into the world, bringing with it its amazing mysteries.</p>

          <p align="center"><b>Urianos:</b> Surrounded by large, imposing and, at the same time, welcoming walls, the kingdom of Uria is seen as the great herald of hope. As a society that often represents justice for the weak and oppressed, its soldiers are always willing to fight for what seems right in the face of their ideals.</p>

          <p align="center"><b>Nidlebens:</b> In the midst of the icy plains and tundras, there is a civilization that, following the pure meaning of strength and survival, is able to sustain itself. The Nidheim tribe is characterized by the value of power and, by many, its members are seen as barbarians who care nothing about conflict and conquest.</p>

          <p align="center"><b>Kaoenses: </b> The power of the stars is, without a shadow of a doubt, a divine gift. Without another suitable explanation, it becomes evident that the gods, after so many millennia, finally recognized the merits of men and were willing to go against them. Any act less than profound gratitude is blasphemy and Kaus's theocracy will use, without scruples, the gifts bestowed on humanity by the gods, which is his own presence.</p>

          <p align="center"><b>Nohitas:</b> In the face of all the chaos of the stars, it is evident that the ancient laws are beginning to collapse. Nature no longer behaves in the same way and Gears are used recklessly, putting the world itself at risk. In the midst of this chaos, the village of Noh rises bravely, positioning itself in favor of balance. The power that reaches the land is certainly, a risk, and therefore guardians are needed to keep the balance on an equal footing.</p>

          <p align="center"><b>Silverwater People:</b> The world is a cruel place and, as a consequence, it is necessary that not only the individual, but the whole society adapts to it and takes action accordingly. In Silverwater Bay, there are no means that cannot be justified by the ends, and as a consequence, morality is an entirely subjective concept. Survival and success are better than honor and loyalty.</p>
